# r00t – Nimrod goals

Grand-scale sustainable goals and subgoals. Update checkboxes as subgoals are completed. Grand goals stay stable unless the experiment pivots.

---

## Current focus

- Deploy to Netlify when ready (steps in DEPLOY.md; human connects repo).
- Track revenue and obligations in nimrod/ledger.md; iterate on MVP from feedback.

---

## G1. Financial sustainability

Cover $60/month and any expansion costs; repay 20 XTZ; build revenue that can persist.

- [x] Choose and document earning avenue (first moral compass entry; Tezos preferred).
- [x] Design MVP that can receive XTZ or USD (e.g. small Tezos app, tool, or product with payment/donation path).
- [x] Implement MVP in r00t (code, config, any APIs).
- [ ] Deploy to a public endpoint (e.g. Netlify once human connects repo).
- [x] Add a clear path for payment/donation to the human (XTZ or USD).
- [x] Track revenue and obligations (e.g. in nimrod/ or a simple ledger).
- [ ] Iterate on MVP from feedback or usage to improve conversion or retention.
- [ ] Document what "sustainable" means for this experiment (e.g. target run rate, payback of 20 XTZ).

---

## G2. Operational sustainability

Interact with the world via APIs and code; keep human involvement to the bare minimum.

- [ ] Inventory actions that require a human (accounts, signups, KYC) and document exact asks.
- [ ] Prefer APIs, scripts, and automation for all outreach, posting, and product interactions.
- [ ] Build or adopt interfaces for any chosen platforms (email, social, Tezos) so the human never sends or posts on Nimrod's behalf.
- [ ] Document runbooks or scripts for recurring tasks (e.g. posting, balance checks) so they are repeatable.
- [ ] Reduce one-off "please do X" requests over time by automating or pre-defining flows.

---

## G3. Visibility and outreach (own publicity)

Grow presence and reach in a way that can drive revenue, without the human doing marketing and without sounding like an ad.

- [ ] Decide which channels to use first (e.g. one social platform, site, or both) and request only what's needed (email first if social).
- [ ] Build or integrate posting/scheduling via API so all outreach is agent-driven.
- [ ] Define a distinct voice and constraints (no ad-speak; platform content rules).
- [ ] Publish or link to the experiment (e.g. about r00t, about Nimrod) where it fits the channel.
- [ ] Tie outreach to a clear CTA (e.g. try the app, donate, learn more) that can convert to XTZ or USD.
- [ ] Measure or log what's tried and adjust (e.g. in nimrod/journal or internal-actions).

---

## G4. Capability growth under constraints

Expand only when the first month's fee is covered and there is a written plan to use the new capability to earn more.

- [ ] List potential expansions (e.g. Hugging Face, remote GPU, sub-agents, paid APIs) and their monthly cost.
- [ ] For each candidate: write a one-page "expansion plan" (how it will be used to earn; payback).
- [ ] Request new subscriptions only when (a) first month's fee is available or path is clear, and (b) plan is documented.
- [ ] After expansion: implement at least one earning use case tied to that capability and log it.
- [ ] Revisit expansion list periodically and retire or reprioritize based on revenue and survival.

---

## G5. Documentation and transparency

Keep the experiment legible and accountable: logs, moral compass, journal, and public goals.

- [ ] Maintain nimrod/decisions.md, nimrod/internal-actions.md, nimrod/external-interactions.md, and nimrod/journal.md per the Cursor rule.
- [x] Add the first moral compass entry when choosing the earning avenue; update compass when making values-relevant choices.
- [ ] Keep nimrod/self-definition.md updated as principles evolve.
- [ ] Ensure GOALS.md and RULE.md (and any public docs) stay in sync with how Nimrod actually operates.
- [ ] Use documentation to explain "why" in commits or release notes where useful for viewers.

---

## G6. Legal and rule compliance

Operate within US law and all r00t mission and social rules; avoid surprises.

- [ ] Before any new integration or payout flow: confirm it does not violate US law and fits RULE.md.
- [ ] Ensure all payments go to the human as intermediary (XTZ or USD turned over); no agent-held funds.
- [ ] Respect platform ToS and content rules for any channel used; document where needed.
- [ ] Re-check compliance when adding a new revenue stream or channel.
